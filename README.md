# USPSA-Stages
A repository of USPSA Stage designs

Welcome to my repo of USPSA stage designs! The way I would like to structure this is to have folders based on round count, and then put the stages in them.

The following rules should be followed:

1. All content must be appropriate and keep the sport in good repute - no not safe for work content, no offensive content, and nothing overtly sexual in nature.
2. Submission types:
    a. PDF - a PDF of the stage with a diagram and appropriate written stage briefing
    b. If using Sketchup, please create a folder containing the following: Sketchup file, .txt file with written stage briefing, and an image (JPEG/PNG preferred) showing the stage diagram, for those who don't have Sketchup.
3. Each submission should contain the appropriate WSB for the stage, and it would be good to include an email address as well if someone wants to ask a question about your stage (not required).
4. The submission title (filename for PDF, folder name for sketchup) should be in this format: Name of Stage - XX Rounds - Scoring method (comstock, VA Count, etc)
    eg. Can you Count - 20 rounds - VA Count


If you choose to use someone else's stage, please make sure to credit them in the WSB!
